# Student-Management-System
Developed a console-based College Student Management System in C++ to manage student records, including details such as name, roll number, CNIC, class, address, phone number, and previous result. This system performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using file handling techniques.

Key Features:

Create: Add new student records by capturing details such as name, roll number (unique key), CNIC (13 characters), class (11th or 12th), address, phone number (11 characters), and previous result.
Read: Display all existing student records stored in a binary file.
Update: Modify the details of an existing student record by searching with the roll number.
Delete: Remove student records by roll number, ensuring the integrity of the remaining data.
